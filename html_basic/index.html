  <p>Paragraph 1: This page demonstrates basic semantic HTML: headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>), paragraph tags, and an accessible image link. It is intended as a minimal, well-structured example for learning and testing.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 2: The clickable image above links to an external site and includes an <code>alt</code> attribute for accessibility. The link opens in a new tab so users can explore without leaving the current page.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 3: Use this template as a starting point for your own projects. You can replace the image URL, update text, or add more content sections such as lists, forms, or embedded media as needed.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 4: Small design details — like spacing, readable fonts, and clear headings — make content easier to scan and more pleasant to read. This simple layout keeps the focus on structure and accessibility.</p>
